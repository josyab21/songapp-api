Song App 
Overview
The backend of the Song CRUD App is built using Node.js and Express.js framework. It serves as the API server responsible for handling CRUD operations on the songs data stored in a MongoDB database. This backend application ensures efficient data management and communication between the frontend and the database.

Technologies Used
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for building APIs.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing song data.
Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
dotenv: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
cors: A middleware for Express.js to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
Installation
To set up the backend of the Song CRUD App locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/josyab21/songapp-api.git

Navigate to the backend directory: cd backend

Install dependencies:

npm install
Set up environment variables:

API Endpoints
The backend provides the following API endpoints:

GET /api/songs: Get all songs.
GET /api/songs/:id: Get a specific song by ID.
POST /api/songs: Create a new song.
PUT /api/songs/:id: Update an existing song by ID.
DELETE /api/songs/:id: Delete a song by ID.
